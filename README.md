ATHN Development Team Values
============================

Team
---------------------------------
We check our egos at the door. Our codebase is owned by all of us, from the best features, and most elegant implementations, to the worst bugs, and biggest omega mess. We use `git blame` to discover where understanding might be lacking or to discuss better solutions. We make mistakes sometimes, because we’re human, but rather than dwell on them we choose to fix and then learn from them.

Purpose
---------------------------------
Our code changes lives. Every commit and every feature goes out the door with the sole purpose of positively impacting the lives of bleeding disorders patients and those who care for them. We actively integrate the team with the bleeding disorders community. We know our users by name.

Diversity
---------------------------------
We value unique perspectives that come from individual experience, race, gender, age, sexual orientation, culture and religion. We recognize that when a group of people work in close proximity there will be misunderstandings. Actions and words that may seem perfectly acceptable to one team member may hurt and offend others. Our team wants its members to feel safe and comfortable. Anyone can express discomfort and hurt to another without the fear of their feelings being dismissed or ignored. We genuinely care about one another. 

Learning rate, IQ, physical strength, energy level, disorders and diseases affect every team member to a certain degree. This impacts their ability to do their job in an unavoidable way. We shape our interactions and each other's roles to fit the individual to the best of our ability within the framework of our values.

Communication
---------------------------------
We believe that many problems can be addressed through better communication. We do not hoard information. We feel that getting an answer from another team member should be as easy as swiveling a chair. 

Pairing
---------------------------------
We believe for a myriad of reasons that pairing is a key to our success as a development team. Pairing is one of our best tools for increasing quality, knowledge sharing and happiness.

We strive to be egoless pairs. We recognize that pairing exposes ignorance and deficiencies. Shipping working software is a learning process and exposing ourselves is an opportunity to learn and grow.

Craftsmanship
---------------------------------
We care deeply about how we work, the code we write, and the products we produce. We are constantly striving to become better at our craft. Our passion leads us to have strong opinions loosely held. We value constructive debate and deep discussions about the benefits and tradeoffs of each decision we make as pairs and as a team. We value shipping quality software that makes a positive impact on people's lives.

We make pragmatic (often boring) technology choices at work. We don’t build science projects just because we are smart enough to build them. 

We take time on a regular basis to put aside the pressure to ship and focus on craftsmanship. This is a team activity where all members are involved in helping each other level up. We call this ATHNuniversity.

Learning and Mentoring
---------------------------------
We all have room to improve. None of us have so mastered the craft that we cannot benefit from learning new techniques, technologies, best practices or processes. It is our combined duty to share what we have mastered both inside and outside our team. We love to teach and to learn from each other.

Agility
---------------------------------
We adhere strongly, but not dogmatically, to the tenants of the Agile Manifesto and Twelve Principles of Agile Software. We adapt our process to minimize ceremony, and maximize communication, efficiency and happiness. We deliver quality code while working at a sustainable pace.

- TDD: Red, Green, Refactor. We believe in the power of testing and its ability to help us write small decoupled components that are easy to reuse and simple to change. We refactor constantly, sometimes ruthlessly.

- Proximity: We all work side by side. This facilitates communication and knowledge sharing. We share information and friendship. 

- Change: We fearlessly embrace change. No feature, implementation, or style is sacred. 

Fun
---------------------------------
We write code because it is fun and we enjoy working with each other. We also recognize that all code and no play makes for grumpy devs. We provide opportunities for the team to have a good time both during and after work.
