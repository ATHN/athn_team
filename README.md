ATHN Development Team Values
============================

Team
---------------------------------
We check our egos at the door. Our codebase is owned by all of us, from the best features, and most elegant implementations, to the worst bugs, and biggest omega mess. We use `git blame` to discover where understanding might be lacking or to discuss better solutions.

Pairing
---------------------------------
We believe for a myriad of reasons that pairing is a key to our success as a development team. Pairing is one of our best tools for increasing quality, knowledge sharing and happiness.

Fun
---------------------------------
We write code because it is fun and we enjoy working with each other. We also recognize that all code and no play makes for grumpy devs. We strive to provide opportunities for the team to have a good time both during and after work.

Communication
---------------------------------
We believe that many problems can be addressed through better communication. We do not hoard information. We feel that getting an answer from another team member should be as easy as swiveling a chair. 

Craftsmanship
---------------------------------
We care deeply about how we work, the code we write, and the products we produce. We are constantly striving to become better at our craft. Our passion leads us to have strong opinions loosely held. We value constructive debate and deep discussions about the benefits and tradeoffs of each decision we make as pairs and as a team.  We value shipping quality software that makes a positive impact on people's lives.

Learning and Mentoring
---------------------------------
We all have room to improve. None of us have so mastered the craft that we cannot benefit from learning new techniques, technologies, best practices or processes. It is our combined duty to share what we have mastered both inside and outside our team. We love to teach and to learn from each other.

Agility
---------------------------------
We adhere strongly, but not dogmatically, to the tenants of the Agile Manifesto and Twelve Principles of Agile Software. We adapt our process to minimize ceremony, and maximize communication, efficiency and happiness. We deliver quality code while working at a sustainable pace.

Diversity
---------------------------------
We value unique perspectives that come from individual experience, race, gender, age, sexual orientation, culture and religion. We recognize that when a group of people work in close proximity there will be misunderstandings. Actions and words that may seem perfectly acceptable to one team member may hurt and offend others. Our team wants its members to feel safe and comfortable. Anyone can express discomfort and hurt to another without the fear of their feelings being dismissed or ignored. We genuinely care about one another.
